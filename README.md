## Background
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are commonly deployed to aid the operation of critical infrastructures, such as electric power systems. Existing electric power SCADA systems are being augmented with Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) to monitor and control wide areas by networking these PMUs into existing SCADA frameworks. The PMUs embedded into the Smart Grid testbed must be probed, leading to the development of possible attack vectors and a suite of several cyber-attacks targeting the testbed. 

## Project Goal
Develop a suite of cyber attacks against the smart-grid testbench that exploit SCADA control protocols and manipulate PMU data.
